# hello-world
Braven here. Trans Tenor, Medium, Game dev noob.
Just made my first game.
-52 seconds past the submission means Failure To Launch. I entered my first Game Jam 2 weeks ago, and I missed the submission deadline by some minutes. I'm sad, but I now have a really fun noob prototype masterpiece and a bunch more knowledge on making videogames.
